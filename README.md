Computer Vision: Stereo and Motion 
==============================
## Computer Vision Topics: Stereo, Epipolar Geometry, Motion

This repository contains material exploring the concepts of stereo and motion vision. Additionally, MATLAB code is provided which outlines approaches to estimate the fundamental matrix. The approaches include:
* manual selection of corresponding points 
* automatic selection of corresponding points using the cross correlation metric 
* automatic selection of corresponding features using edge detection and cross correlation
